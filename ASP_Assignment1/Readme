Assignment 1 :
Folder contains 
1) Mapper.c
2) Reducer.c
3) Combiner.c
4) Input.txt
5) Makefile
6) run.sh


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mapper.c

Takes input.txt file where the data has been stored in form of tuples;
The data has been split into 3 parts; UserID, action, topic
The mapper checks the action and accordingly adds a score to the tuple;
like : UserdID,topic,score. The mapper displays the output as well as stores
the output in form of txt file named as Mapper_Output.txt

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reducer.c

Takes stdin Mapper_Output.txt. The reducer's main purpose is to add up the 
same Userid,topic's score together. Since we are considering a stdin, we have
used scanf instead of fgets for simplicity. The use of structures simplify the 
whole process of adding up the scores. 
> for loop logic 
	a) first travers through userid
	b) then scan for topics
	c) if previous and current topics match add scores(using flag logic)
	d) only print if its traversed through all the userid's
	e) if topics dont match then print
	d) go to next userid

Combiner.c 

ref : https://github.com/bradfa/tlpi-dist/blob/master/pipes/pipe_ls_wc.c
Basically the mapper will be forked first; the read pipe is unused in the first fork;
we only use the write fork here and direct it to STDOUT.

for reducer fork the write pipe is unused and the read fork is used to direct the data from STDIN.

run following commands in the shell.
make 
make test
