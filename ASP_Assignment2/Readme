Combiner.c 

For this assignment since we are using pthreads instead of processes; I have implemented mapper and reducer as a function in the combiner.c file.
We have created n+1 threads; one for mapper and the rest for reducer( which is our arguement)
According to your objective we need to adjust our reducer buffers according to user's choice.
I have implemented the mapper code with reference to first assignment reducer;(removed the use of strtok)
Mutex region has been identified; used Conditional signals. 

I have used a uniq int in my struct which is additional element to my first assignment; 
this helps me identify unique user id's since at a time one thread only calculates sum of one user id topics;
hence this is achieved with uniq variable. The rest of the code is similar to First assignment.
